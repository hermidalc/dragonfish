# functional-profiler

A novel functional metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiler and framework
that leverages more recent methdological advances in the field of computational
and algorithmic genomics and relevant published software, which can efficiently
store, index, and represent large collections of genomes and transcriptomes,
perform fast and accurate alignment of short reads from whole shotgun
metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequencing experiments to such an index, and
accurately quantify the abundance of aligned reads to functional categories
while also providing species- and strain-level contribution to functional
abundances.
